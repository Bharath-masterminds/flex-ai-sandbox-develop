#Prerequisites

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r ./reusables/vectorizers/samples/samples-requirements.txt
```

create local directory

~/vector-store-playground/




# Customize

    change value of "source_code_relative_directory" to some folder that exists in your machine

    you can change the glob_filter to "*.java", "*.xml", whatever glob filter you'd like

HINT:
    start out with a directory with only a few files while doing basic tests.
    
    then move on to directories with many files.  remember, you are sending the files to the AI engine and using token$.

# Run the code:

reusables/vectorizers/samples/VectorStoreWriteReadSample.py


Look inside your '~/vector-store-playground/' for output.
